# Other and one-off forms

- **HR-ON (same-origin iframe, e.g. EIVA):** if the uploader doesn't register the file ("no files has been uploaded"), choose "I want to type my résumé" and paste text: `pdftotext -layout <CV_PATH> -`. Quill editor: `editor.innerText = cv` + `input` event, then click → `End` → space → `BackSpace`.
- **Alfa Jobs (welovealfa.com):** scroll locks after the country combobox. Drive everything by JS: combobox `.click()`, option from `[role=option]` by text `.click()`, text via setter. Turnstile self-solves.
- **Huzzle:** `form_input`+ref one field at a time; a bulk setter script got blocked ("[Real-World Transactions]"). Draft: "Save this application?" → Save.
- **Siemens (jobs.siemens.com):** session drops silently (`/Error`, `/Login`); verify session after each step; check posting status before retrying.
- **Viterbit:** setter works. City dropdown: click dropdown → click its search box separately (first typing swallowed) → type only the part of the name with no non-ASCII letters → click option. Reject cookies: `s-rall-bn`.
- **select2-style widgets (e.g. In4Matic):** `option.selected=true`+`change` leaves the placeholder visible = not selected → real clicks.
- **BambooHR (content):** read "Minimum Experience" (e.g. Manager/Supervisor) at the end of `get_page_text` — the employer's own seniority tag.
- **BambooHR (form), measured 9 Oct 2026:** "Apply for This Job" opens the form on the same page. Tenants can make Address, City, Province and Postal Code all required, so a profile without a street and postcode cannot finish it. The file input is hidden: give it an id, make it visible, then `file_upload`. Country is a custom select that may already show the right country. A honeypot text field ("Please leave this field blank", far off-screen) sits first in the DOM; never fill it. The visible reCAPTCHA makes every BambooHR form a hand-off anyway.

## JobDiva (staffing-agency portals, `*.jobdiva.com/portal`)

- "Apply Now" offers three paths; **Quick Apply (No Account)** needs no account: first and last name, email, phone with its own country picker, CV, an SMS-consent box (leave unticked) and a data-storage consent for job placement (application consent). Success reads "You've applied! Good luck!". Measured 2 Oct.
- The LinkedIn apply URL carries a session in its query string; if it is cut at `?` the portal answers "Session Expired". Navigate with the full URL.

## Aplitrak / Broadbean (`aplitrak.com/?adid=…`, recruiter postings)

- Name, email, phone, CV and an eligibility radio ("currently eligible to work … in the country to which I am applying"). A JS `.click()` on `submit_btn` does nothing; a coordinate click on "Apply Now" submits and lands on `generic/submit.cgi` with "Thank you for submitting your application". Measured 2 Oct.

## Getro VC job boards (`*.getro.com/companies/<co>/jobs/<id>`)

- "Apply now" opens a modal that requires a LinkedIn URL before it reveals the employer's link, and submitting it makes the profile visible to the fund's portfolio companies. That is a talent-network opt-in the candidate has not given: hand off, or find the employer's own ATS. Measured 2 Oct.

## Mantu careers (`careers.mantu.com/brands/<brand>/jobs/<id>`, Amaris Consulting and the other Mantu brands)

- One-page form under the posting: first name, surname, email, phone (intl-tel-input, detects the country from a `+` number; the "between 0 and 15 digits" line under it is help text, not an error), a required résumé upload (`input[name=resume]`, `file_upload` works) and a required box "I agree to Mantu's Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy". That box is a terms acceptance: fill everything else and hand off. Invisible reCAPTCHA v3 badge only. The posting header carries the job's working language ("Permanent Job · Turkish"), which settles a language question the English description leaves open. Cookie banner: "Deny". Measured 10 Oct 2026.

## Microsoft (`apply.careers.microsoft.com`)

- "Apply now" goes to a sign-in page (Microsoft, LinkedIn, Google or Facebook account) before any form. Account wall: hand off. Measured 2 Oct.

## CleverStaff (`cleverstaff.net/i/vacancy-<id>`)

- Apply opens a modal: first name, surname, email, phone, one custom "CV or LinkedIn" field (a textarea plus up to two files), and a required consent to processing "for this and other vacancies". `form_input` fills the text fields.
- ⛔ **The file upload succeeds on the server and is still rejected by the form.** Measured 2 Oct: `file_upload` on the hidden `input[type=file]` posted to `/hr/public/addCvFile` (200, status ok), no file chip appeared, and Apply returned "You should fill all obligatory fields" with "Select file" under the field. The input carries `ng-click="selectFile(custom, $event)"`, which records which field the next upload belongs to; a programmatic upload skips that click, so the callback has no field to attach the file to. Call it first, then upload:
  ```js
  const f=document.querySelector('input[type=file]');const s=angular.element(f).scope();
  const c=s.$parent.custom;const root=s.$parent.$parent.$parent;root.selectFile(c,{target:f});root.$apply();
  ```
  Then `file_upload` on the same ref. An "Added file" toast and a chip under the textarea confirm it; `custom.files` holds the attachment id.
- Confirmation is a modal: "Thanks! The employer has got your application".

## Oracle Cloud HCM candidate sites (`*.fa.*.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/…/apply/email`)

- The first screen asks for an email and says the candidate profile "will be created and kept up to date automatically". That is account creation: hand off. Measured 2 Oct (Marriott).

## Google Forms (`forms.gle/…`, `docs.google.com/forms/…`)

- A form with a file upload records the signed-in Google account's email ("The name, email address and photo associated with your Google Account will be recorded when you upload files"). If the browser's Google account is not the profile's application email, that address goes to the employer with the CV. Check the account line at the top of the form before filling; if it is the wrong address, hand off. Measured 2 Oct.
